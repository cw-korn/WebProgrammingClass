      This is a picture of a Cessna 210. The 210 is the flagship 
      single-engine Cessna aircraft. Although the 210 began as a 
      four-place aircraft, it soon acquired a third row of seats, 
      stretching it to a six-place plane. The 210 is classified 
      as a high-performance airplane, which means its landing 
      gear is retractable and its engine has more than 200 
      horsepower. In its first model year, which was 1960, 
      the 210 was powered by a 260-horsepower fuel-injected 
      six-cylinder engine that displaced 471 cubic inches. 
      The 210 is the fastest single-engine airplane ever 
      built by Cessna.
